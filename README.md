# ch32v003-vanilla-gcc
Firmware for CH32V003 that's compilable with standard, open-source RISC-V GCC.

Some files are from https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun .

I was looking for something more readable than makefiles, unfortunately currently there is hand written ninja.build file. Use ninja command instead of make.
